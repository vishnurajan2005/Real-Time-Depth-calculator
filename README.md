# üìè Object Distance Estimation using OpenCV

Estimate the **real-time distance** of an object from your webcam using computer vision techniques. This project uses color detection and basic geometry to determine how far an object is from the camera.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- Real-time object detection using color (HSV filtering).
- Calculates and displays the distance of the object from the camera.
- Green bounding box with **object name** and **distance**.
- Adjustable HSV threshold for different colored objects.
- Beginner-friendly code structure.

---

Steps involved:
- Capture a reference image at a known distance.
- Detect the object using its color (HSV range).
- Calculate focal length from reference image.
- Estimate distance from current frame using object width.
